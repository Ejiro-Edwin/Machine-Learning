# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log
I will keep on adding my everyday work in this repository
## Day 01- July 08, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Logistic Regression and it's applications.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with application in Python initially, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.I am well versed with virtual environments, Jupyter Notebook,basic Python libraries such as Numpy,Pandas, Matplotlib etc. I have also understood more about Logistic and Linear Regression in detail and understood the difference between both.
